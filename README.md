# thesis_code
This code is used to fufill my thesis project: detecting purchasing probability's in real-time using LSTM-RNN, RNN and GRU.

The detecting_probability.py is the file used to train and test the LSTM-RNN, SimpleRNN and GRU models. In the main.py the probability are calculated in real-time. The other files are used to implement real-time data collection and processing using the Google Cloud enviroment. The way all files are used is desribed in chapter 3 of the thesis.
