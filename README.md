# thesis_code
This code is used to fufill my thesis project: detecting purchasing probability's in real-time using LSTM-RNN, RNN and GRU.

The detecting_probability.py is the file used to train and test the LSTM-RNN, SimpleRNN and GRU models.
The other files are used to detect probability's in real-time using the Google Cloud enviroment. The way all files are used is desribed in chapter 3 of the thesis
